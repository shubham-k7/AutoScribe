For every image-
Call person check function
Call crop function to get only the board
Divide image into 3/4 equal parts
Call enhance function on each part
Call check difference function to see if there has been a significant change from the previous part
If yes, append the part to final set of images
Basically harr iteration off loop mei we will compare with the parts of the board from the previous part
